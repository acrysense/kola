                    <p>
                        Kola Reserve benefits from its location on the boarder of White and Barents seas, as we have summer and autumn run. Whilst the start of the run varies significantly with the growing weather fluctuations, we anticipate that it resembles that of the neighboring camps on the peninsula.<br><br>
                        Summer<br>
                        Our scouting missions in 2019 and 2020 have validated the predominantly stronger run in summer, with chrome bright fish beginning to enter the systems from the last week of May, usually peaking in the 3 week of June and presisting to middle of July. <br><br>

                        Mid June, is the Prime time to visit Kola Reserve, with cool weather, absence of mosquitoes and  flourishing Atlantic Salmon in the rivers. As the summer progresses, salmon remains in the river, but the typically warmer weather awakens the importunate insects.In august, later part of July we are hosting walking Youth Tours to Lumbovka at a lower pricing point, yet uncompromising on the fishing and lodging experience.<br><br>

                        Autumn<br>
                        We are one of a few camps on the peninsular enjoying the Osenka (autumn) salmon run. Commencing in the 2nd week of september, White Sea Salmon begin to rush up Lumbovka and Kachkocka streams. Whilst smaller in size, this breed is typically muscular and persistent, having to spend the whole winter in the rivers.  Our season terminates

                    <p>
                        <a href="#">VISAS</a><br><br>
 
                        All foreign nationals fishing on the Kola Reserve will require a Tourist Visa to enter Russia. Acquiring this visa can be a little laborious - particularly for British Nationals - but it is a fairly straightforward process. Around twelve weeks before your trip, please contact Kola Reserve for all relevant paperwork and to help we will help organise your visa.<br><br> 

                        If you are a British Passport holder, you will be required to attend a VFS application centre in either London or Edinburgh to hand in your passport and visa application documents, and to provide your barometric data – ie. your fingerprints. Your final documents will be sent to you approximately two weeks prior to departure.<br><br>

                        If you are a USA Passport holder, The Fly Shop will help you to prepare all the necessary documents and carry forwards with the application. Please consult your sales manager (or Justin Miller from the Fly Shop) for all the details.<br><br>
                        
                        We suggest that you duplicate or photocopy all documents, including your passport and Russian Visa. Ensure that you keep these copies separate from your originals when you travel. This will be hugely helpful if your passport is mislaid.<br><br>
                        
                        <a href="#">TRAVEL INSURANCE</a><br><br>
                        
                        Please ensure that you have adequate insurance cover for your trip. Occasionally we can experience delays in Russia due to unforeseen circumstances and flight connections can occasionally be missed, resulting in extra charges.<br><br>
                        
                        If your insurers do not offer comprehensive Medical Evacuation –
                        ( Medivac ) Insurance we strongly recommend Global Rescue

                        FLIGHTS<br><br>
                        
                        The Kola Reserve will fish from Sunday to Sunday.<br><br>
                        
                        Anglers will fly into Murmansk and will then be transported in a comfortable bus to Lovozero Helibase, where we will fly the group to the Kola Reserve in a Mi8 Helicopter.<br><br>
                        
                        1)	Route with an overnight stay in Murmansk<br><br>
                        
                        We advise that you fly via Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport prior to your arrival in Murmansk.
                        We suggest that you book your flights to arrive to Murmansk on Saturday and spend the Saturday-Sunday night in the Azimut Murnask hotel, at 5,100 Rub per night. This price is a discount with the Azimut hotel and in order to exercise it, please let us know in advance.  We believe Azimut to be the best hotel in the city, therefore we can confidently recommend it to use by our guests (link).<br><br>
                        
                        A Kola Reserve bus will collect the group from the hotel lobby at 9 am.<br><br>
                        
                        2)	Route with an overnight stay in Moscow
                        An alternative travel route can be with an overnight stay in Moscow, from Sat-Sun. We don’t recommend taking this option, since it poses risk of delays and so forth. However, if it is the only available option for your travel, we will lay it out for your convenience.<br><br>
                        
                        If you fly into Moscow Sheremetyevo on Saturday evening, you can spend a night in the Radisson hotel, prior to your flight to Murmansk on Sunday morning.<br><br>
                        
                        The Radisson Blu is an excellent, modern and extremely comfortable hotel just a 4-minute walk from the airport.  It has an excellent restaurant and great facilities, and most anglers bound for the Kola rendezvous here.<br><br>
                        
                        On Sunday morning anglers can then catch the early flight from Sheremetyevo which arrives to Murmansk at around 10 am. We suggest taking an Aeroflot flight SU1320, as described by this link.<br><br>
                        
                        Upon arrival to Murmansk, at no later than 10am, a Kola Reserve bus will collect the fisherman for a drive toward the helicopter base.<br><br>
                        
                        DRIVE TO THE HELIBASE<br><br>
                        
                        The bus road trip should take up to 2 hours and will accommodate for all the guests and their luggage. The road towards the helicopter base is relatively smooth and has been recently layed by the local government. We don’t plan to make any stops along the way for the lack of sites, so if you will require anything specific along the way, please do let us know.<br><br>
                        
                        RETURN<br><br>
                        
                        After 6 full days fishing, We will fly back out of the camp on the following Sunday ( in the Mi 8 Helicopter, in time to catch the Murmansk > Sheremetyevo flight. <br><br>

                        A MI-8 helicopter will depart for Lovozero from the main camp at 11.30am, arriving to Lovozero by 1pm. At this point, the group will be on boarded onto a bus heading to Murmansk Airport.<br><br>
                        
                        We arrive back at Murmansk Airport at around 4pm on Sunday, so we strongly advise you do not book your onward flight from Murmansk before 6pm. We can help you with these arrangements if you wish.

                    <p>
                        The Kola Reserve is in a remote location. Despite the luxurious facilities, guests should remember that they are a long way from civilization, and should make sure that they bring any specific personal items required with them<br><br>
                        
                        HEALTH AND MEDICATION<br><br>
                        
                        Make sure that you have any required medicines with you. The Kola Reserve is in a very remote location, and although there will be a basic medical kit in the camp, be aware that you will not be able to access any pharmaceutical products. Do not travel if you develop a serious medical condition.<br><br>

                        Beer, wine, and vodka will all be available in the lodge. If you want to bring your own favorite tipple, it is best to buy it during the layover in Moscow or Murmansk and bring it with you. We will have a selection of surcharge alcohol on-site, with payments via a card reader. If you require anything specific with which we can help, please let us know in advance.<br><br>
                        
                        ELECTRICITY<br><br>
                        
                        The Kola Reserve Lodge has a generator supplying 220v to Euro 2-pin plugs. If you use UK and US electrical plugs, you will need a suitable adapter. The generators will be switched off during the day and at night, so it is best to bring energy-efficient devices that will charge swiftly.<br><br>

                        The latitude of the camps means that it is light for 24hrs a day during the summer season. The rooms will feature light-excluding blinds, but you might consider a “sleep mask” if you think that this will help you sleep.<br><br>
                        
                        MOSQUITOES<br><br>
                        
                        In the early season, mosquitoes and blackflies are not a problem. Towards the end of June, however, they do start to become an issue, especially if there is no wind. We suggest that you bring a DEET based Repellent, preferably a roll-on that is easily stowed. Pack it in a small, robust container as DEET can cause terrible damage to expensive fly lines and precious fly collections.<br><br>
                        
                        A wide brimmed hat with a built-in mosquito net is also an excellent investment which may come in useful on windless days<br><br>
                        
                        Also consider antihistamine cream and cetirizine hydrochloride tablets if you are strongly affected by bites.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        CASH<br><br>
                        
                        You will need some cash to pay for gratuities to the personnel, and also for any flies, leader or sundry items bought from the Lodge Tackle Shop. There will be a card machine at the lodge as well, at your convenience.<br><br>
                        
                        GRATUITIES<br><br>
                        
                        Tips are entirely at your personal discretion. However, it is customary to reward the guides and also the camp staff if you feel that they merit it. We recommend 10% from the trip price in a 60-40 breakdown.<br><br>

                        The Kola Reserve is in a remote location and there is no mobile phone reception.<br><br>
                        
                        There will however be Wi-Fi facilities, so you will be able to stay in communication with the outside world. Wi-Fi will be a paid service with 20$ for 2 Gb of data. Through the internet connection our guests can use the Wi-Fi calling technology, which, if pre-set on personal devices before the visit, can be used to call all onthe cellular phones around the globe.<br><br>

                        A small camera is invaluable for recording your trophy fish.<br>
                        A rugged model that is compact, robust and waterproof can be retained in a jacket pocket, ready for use.<br>
                        Make sure you bring a charger and that you have enough room on your memory card. The Kola Reserve is a very special place and you will want to take a lot of pictures.<br><br>
                        
                        When photographing your trophy, please handle your fish with wet hands. Keep the fish submerged at all times until you are absolutely ready to take the pictures. Then lift the fish JUST clear of the water for  just a few seconds, supporting the fish’s weight and keeping the fish’s head in the water or JUST above it.<br><br>
                        
                        Return the fish to the water while you very quickly review the pictures and then release it.<br><br>
                        
                        The Kola Reserve is committed to the long-term sustainability of the fishery, and wants all of its visitors to respect this ethic, by caring for the fish and returning them to the water as quickly and carefully as possible. Please bear this in mind at all times, so that the fish of The Kola Reserve can be allowed to flourish.

                    <h3 id="title4">About the fishing</h3>
                    <p>
                        GENERAL<br><br>

                        The Kola Reserve is situated just inside the Arctic Circle. This means that it is often subject to extreme weather conditions.<br><br>
                        
                        The key to getting the best out of the fishing is VERSATILITY - being able to react to respond and adapt to prevailing conditions. This is a maxim that you can apply to how you fish, what you wear… in fact your whole attitude to the trip.<br><br>
                        
                        Each day anglers are rotated between the many beats on the 2 different rivers. You will have access to about 40km of fishable water and you will rotate to enjoy different beats every day of the week. Days are long on the rivers of the Kola Reserve. In fact it is daylight 24 hours a day, in the middle of the summer, being north of the arctic circle. You will fish long and hard on your assigned beat everyday, and then you are welcome to fish at night, on one of the world’s finest home pools until 1am, if you have the energy.<br><br>

                        POOL ROTATIONS<br><br>

                        To help the anglers get around the pools we deploy a small helicopter and ATVs. Further pools and Kachkovka will be covered by helicopter flights, whilst the closer pools are operated via on land vehicles and boats. <br><br>

                        On Kachkovka we have emergency accommodation, if the weather restrains the travel.<br><br>

                        CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENT AND FISHING TECHNIQUES<br><br>
                        
                        At the start of the season, in early/mid-June, the winter is only just starting to recede into spring. Snow is a very real possibility and temperatures can  fluctuate from as low as 20°F to perhaps 50° F (-6°C to 10°C). Water temperatures are typically very cold, ranging from 32°F (0°C) to 50°F (10°C). The water is also likely to be affected by snowmelt and spring rains.<br><br>
                        
                        The water will also most likely be relatively high. This means that although the Kola salmon are unusually aggressive, they will be less inclined to come to the surface. Until the water reaches around 8 degrees, anglers will typically be best served by employing Skagit lines that can boss heavy sink tips and relatively big, heavy tubes. Big, bold weighted tube flies like the German Snaelda , Cascade Franc’n’Snaelda or large Templedogs are good choices. Aim to slow the fly down if the water is cold, employing upstream mends and easing the flies into the soft water. The biggest fish of the season typically arrive in the early season so make sure that you employ strong, abrasion resistant leader material, and strong hooks.<br><br>
                        
                        By mid-late June, air temperatures should climb but can still range anywhere from 32°F to 75° F (0°C to 22°C) with icy rain and even blizzards still very much possible. The water temperature at the end of the month can range from 42°F to 57°F (6°C to 14°C). As the water warms, light intermediate tips or even full floating lines are better choices. Swap out your Skagit for a lighter, longer and more refined Scandi head. Combine it with a long tapered leader and dressed Willy Gunn or Ally’s Shrimp double on size 4 to 10 hooks or a big Sunray Shadow on a plastic tube. Once the water reaches 10 degrees, a hitched Sunray can bring some spectacular results.<br><br>
                        
                        Your presentation should now be much faster and more aggressive. Swap the upstream mend of early season for a downstream mend, which will make the fly fish much faster and higher in the water column . Some anglers employ a figure of eight retrieve, but if you choose to do so, keep the rod tip high to introduce a bow in the line. This will allow the salmon to turn around when it takes the fly before it feels resistance , and means that it will be hooked in the “scissors” - the corner of the mouth. This area offers the best chance of a solid hook-hold.<br><br>
                        
                        By July, the relentless twenty four hour daylight has transformed the tundra. Wild flowers garland the silver birch forest and high summer has come to the arctic circle. Air temperatures are now typically 46°F to 80°F (8°C to 27°C) Now is the time for full floating Scandi lines, small doubles like silver stoats and cascades on 8 to 12 hooks, hitched sun rays and even dry flies like bombers and monster caddis patterns. A big red Frances fished fished slow and deep can often tempt a big resident fish, so make sure you also have a Skagit line and some heavier tips with you to present it effectively.<br><br>

                    <h3 id="title5">About TACKLE for Kola Reserve</h3>
                    <p>
                        While there are opportunities to fish with single-handed rods, particularly in the low water of late season, there is no doubt that being able to spey-cast with a double handed rod will allow you to cover much more water and also to mend and control your line. Anyone who really wants to get the best out of The Kola Reserve should be proficient in spey casting. If you are not, be re-assured that it is not hugely difficult. TFS can advise of a spey-casting instructor near you, and a few lessons should soon have you competent enough to effectively fish the waters of The Kola Reserve. Unlike some of the Kola’s larger and more intimidating rivers, the Lumbovka and the Kachkovka are relatively easy to cover, and offer even casters of intermediate ability the chance to catch a trophy Atlantic Salmon.<br><br>
 
                        <b>Rods</b><br><br>
                        
                        The most popular choice of Spey rods for the North Coast of the Kola are in the 8wt or 10wt category between 12.5 and 15 feet long.<br><br>
                        
                        In view of the chances of a trophy fish, and due to the unpredictable nature of the river and the chances of high water on any given day, I would suggest rods of 13 to 15’ in 9 to 10 weight models. There are now a number of rods that are available as 6 piece travel models, and these allow you to travel with them packed into your holdall, without the need for a separate rod case, which will incur excess baggage charges.<br><br>
                        
                        Bring at least two rods, and bring two rods to the river every day in case of breakages. It is a long way back to the lodge, and watching your friend catch all the fish while you are unable to fish is no fun. Two rods also allow you to rig up two separate set-ups - a heavy tip with a skagit line for deep pools and heavy flies, and a full floating Scandi for fishing smaller flies and Sunday Shadows on the surface.<br><br>
                        
                        By all means bring a single-handed rod for fishing in low, warm water conditions ( maybe a 10’ 9wt or 10wt ), but I would expect to use the double hander for most of the fishing.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>Reels</b><br><br>
                        
                        Ideally bring two reliable and well-maintained reels with at least 300 yards of good backing – use a minimum of 30lb Dacron or 50lb GSP and make sure that it is wound on in tight coils and NOT bedded in from playing a previous fish. The Kola Reserve offers the possibility of hooking a “once-in-a-lifetime” fish, and these fish will test out your equipment. Don’t lose a 30 pounder because your reel is in poor order.<br><br>
                        
                        <b><a href="#">Lines:</a></b><br><br>
                        
                        I would carry set-ups to fish everywhere from on the surface to deep down in cold, heavy water. We are fishing in the Arctic circle, and if winter hangs on, we may be fishing high, heavy water, but if the snow melts before our arrival, we may be fishing much nearer the surface with smaller flies.<br><br>
                        
                        I fish shooting heads that attach to a running line, so that you can change quickly to adapt to conditions.<br><br>
                        
                        I use recommend the following lines and would bring both to cover all eventualities<br><br>
                        
                        The Lumbovka and Kachkovka are typical of most Kola rivers in that they are not particularly deep. This means that there is very little need to bring heavy, full-sinking lines.<br><br>
                        
                        That said, in high water, heavy sink tips  - and the means to cast them and fish them efficiently - are important<br><br>
                        
                        
                        <b>High Cold Water</b><br><br>
                        
                        I like the Rio Skagit Max for 13’ rods or the Skagit Max Long for 15’ rods. The 700 Grain is perfect for 10 weight rods, with 10’ to 15’ T-tips from T-8 to T-14 for fishing heavy tips & large flies. This line casts big flies and heavy tips easily.<br><br>
                        
                        Medium/Low Water<br><br>
                        
                        My ‘go-to’ line for Medium and Low water is the Rio Scandi “Body” 10/11 with the supplied selection of Tips – for fishing lighter tips and smaller tips, and possibly hitched flies and bombers in warm water conditions.<br><br>
                        
                        In short I would ideally aim to bring two Floating Skagit lines and two floating Scandi lines with a set of interchangeable tips.<br><br>
                        
                        To keep thing simple, I carry a set of 15’ RIO tips of Full Floating, Intermediate, Type 3, Type 6 and Type 8 for fishing with the Scandi Body, with three Type 14 tips of 10’, 12.5’ and 15’ for fishing in deep heavy flows with the Skagit.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        <b>Running Line:</b><br><br>
                        
                        I like the Rio Gripshooter 50lb BS, but many prefer a full coated running line – there are many lines available but suggest that you use nothing under 50lb breaking strain.<br>
                        If you use Gripshooter or other mono lines, wait until the fish has turned on the fly and is taking line and then set HARD to account for the stretch in these running lines.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        <b>Leaders/Tippet:</b><br><br>
                        
                        When fishing deep, I use a shorter leader of 5’ to 8’ made up of a level piece of Seaguar Ace in 30lb, 35lb or 44lb Breaking Strain<br><br>
                        
                        In lower water, I like long leaders and favour the Loop Tapered 17’ Leaders in 30lb B/S.<br>
                        These make casting EASIER and will present your fly beautifully in lower, clearer water.<br>
                        If you choose to use Airflo Polyleaders, get the Extra Strong Version in 42lb Breaking Strain.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        Flies<br><br>
                        
                        The exploratory group have designed a fly pack to cover all conditions on The Kola Reserve, and we can organise these for anglers who want them<br><br>
                        
                        
                        Many flies will work, but I like the following patterns:<br><br>

                        Make sure you have really strong tube hooks – Loop or Ken Sawada Doubles are excellent in sizes from 2 to 12, depending on the size of your fly.<br><br>
                        
                        Longwinged flies like Sunday shadows have the tendency to wrap around double or treble hooks.<br>
                        Owner SSW 1/0 to 3/0 Singles nullify this issue and are well worth carrying.<br><br>

                    <h3 id="title6">About CLOTHING for THE KOLA RESERVE</h3>
                    <p>
                        As stated, the Kola Peninsula is situated inside the Arctic Circle. The Kola Reserve has situated at the far North-East tip of the Kola, and can be subject to violent changes in weather and temperature. You need to be ready for all eventualities if you are going to enjoy your time on the Kola Reserve.<br><br>
 
                        If you are warm and dry, you will fish better, and you will be ready when that big trophy salmon takes your fly…<br><br>
                        
                        <b>LAYERING:</b><br><br>
                        
                        The “layering” system works best with today’s top quality synthetic and wool garments. The idea is that by adding or removing multiple layers of clothing, in varying thickness and insulation, you will be able to obtain ideal body temperature and comfort, instead of just one big layer that you are either hot or cold in.<br><br>
                        
                        Start with a good warm base layer of Merino wool or similar and then use mid-layers which you can add or remove.<br><br>
                        
                        I would recommend at least one Primaloft jacket, which can be stuffed into your dry bag and which will keep you very warm when required.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>SOCKS:</b><br><br>
                        
                        Your socks are crucial to keep your feet warm and comfortable - your feet will be submerged in cold - possibly VERY cold water for much of the day and they need to be warm. Make sure that your socks are a good fit with your waders and boots, and try to fish in them a few times before you come, to make sure that your boots are not too tight or too loose when wearing them. A few different pairs of socks will allow you to adjust to what is most comfortable in response to prevailing conditions.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>RAIN GEAR:</b><br><br>
                        
                        Your rain jacket is important - do not skimp on this. It will keep you dry and will also keep you warm by acting as a wind-block. A custom-designed jacket which allows you freedom of movement and places to store your fly-boxes, tippet etc is a crucial piece of your kit.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>HEADWEAR:</b><br><br>
                        
                        Keeping your head warm is important. Use whatever works for you and you may want to use “Balaclava helmet” style headwear or similar to keep your head as warm as possible.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>GLOVES:</b><br><br>
                        
                        Fishing can be a miserable experience if your hands are cold. Fishing gloves or mittens are a vital part of your kit. I like the SNOWBEE LIGHTWEIGHT NEOPRENE GLOVES which I have used for around ten years. They expose only my forefinger and thumb, which is all I need, and keep the rest of my fingers and hand warm even when wet.<br>
                        They also protect my hands from line cuts, fish’s teeth and so on. Highly recommended.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>GLASSES:</b><br><br>
                        
                        ALWAYS wear glasses when fishing, even if you are not sight-fishing. A pair of Polarising glasses not only protects your eyes from stray hooks, it also allows you to see into the water when wading. They are absolutely invaluable in both respects. I always travel with two pairs - A pair of brown tinted polarisers for brighter days, and a pair of High Light Transmission or yellow lenses for low light. Protect the lenses and keep them on a lanyard or retainer. A brightly coloured neoprene “Croakie” will help you to find them if you put them down.<br><br>
                        
                        There are plenty of excellent polarising glasses I use Maui Jim prescription lenses and frames and they are of extremely high quality.<br><br>
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        <b>WADING</b><br><br>
                        
                        <b>Waders</b><br><br>
                        
                        Tough Stockingfoot Chest waders in good condition are essential. Test your waders and mend any holes or replace them with a new pair. The rivers of The Kola Reserve are cold, and you do not want to spend your week wearing waders full of icy water.<br><br>
                        
                        Pair your waders with a pair of solid and comfortable wading boots. They should be felt soled or studded for extra grip.<br><br>
                        
                        <b>Wading Belt</b><br><br>
                        
                        A Wading Belt is essential. It will prevent water filling your waders if you fall in. It will also allow you to attach a retractable wading staff, which is an essential piece of kit on The Kola Reserve Rivers. If you suffer from Lumbar pain issues, Simms and others make back supports that also double as a belt.<br><br>
                        
                        UV Wader Repair is great for making on the spot repairs - make sure you carry some<br><br>
                        
                        The use of wading sticks is essential. The Simms folding staff attached to a retractor is ideal.<br><br>
                        
                        LIFE JACKETS/BUOYANCY AID<br><br>
                        
                        A Lifejacket or self-inflating buoyancy aid will keep you safe when wading. We believe that it is an essential part of your kit.<br><br>
                        
                        One compressed air canister in a buoyancy aid and one replacement canister are allowed by most airlines.<br><br>
                        
                        Pack these in your checked Hold luggage and NOT your hand luggage, and let your air line know that you are travelling with them.<br><br>

                    <h3 id="title7">About FISHING TECHNIQUES for The KOLA RESERVE</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most experienced salmon anglers will know the drill:<br><br>
 
                        Cast, step, repeat…<br><br>
                        
                        However, for those that are new to salmon fishing, here is a brief guide to how to fish each pool.<br><br>
                        
                        Think about what you are trying to do before you start fishing the pool. Do you want to fish the fly quickly, slowly, deep down or near the surface?<br><br>
                        
                        Think about how square you will cast, and whether you will mend upstream or downstream, or not at all.<br><br>
                        
                        Your guide will advise you in detail about this.<br><br>
                        
                        Wade safely and carefully into the river if necessary, and then make your first cast.<br><br>
                        
                        Be ready for a take from the first cast of the day to the last.<br><br>
                        
                        Fish the fly right into the bank and leave it “on the hang” for a few seconds before stripping the fly back prior to your next cast. Once again, a take can come at ANY time, so be ready.<br><br>
                        
                        Then make one to three steps downstream (depending on various factors ) and repeat.<br><br>
                        
                        If a fish takes, let it take the fly and turn away. Do not be in a rush, and only once the fish is drawing away and taking line should you set the hook.<br><br>
                        
                        Getting this right is crucial if you are going to maximise your chances.<br><br>
                        
                        Everyone has their own method, but this works for Matt:<br><br>
                        
                        Matt uses a slack loop of around 1 metre of line that hangs down between the reel and his hand. He holds it in the scissors of his first two fingers, where he simply cannot grip it when he gets a take.<br><br>
                        
                        When the fish takes the fly, the loop allows the fish to turn on the fly without ANY resistance. Others fish “off the reel” with a very light drag, but there has to be SOME resistance with this method, and it means that your drag then has to be adjusted once you are playing the fish. There is also the danger of an over-run.<br><br>
                        
                        If you are using a stretchy mono running line, Matt finds that a smart set, lifting the rod sharply and in to the bank sets the hook, and it has given Matt an excellent ratio of fish encountered to fish on the bank. Once again, remember to WAIT.<br><br>
                        
                        Exclaiming “Fish on!” BEFORE setting the hook helps as a good discipline to make delaying setting the hook.<br><br>
                        
                        About PLAYING A BIG FISH on THE KOLA RESERVE<br><br>
                        
                        Once you have hooked the fish, what next?<br><br>
                        
                        These fish are strong, and they will often surprise you with their acrobatics and bulldozing runs.<br><br>
                        
                        You cannot stop them running, so better to just stay tight and just “enjoy the show”.<br><br>
                        
                        If the fish is a big one, don’t panic, and don’t be in a rush. THIS is the fish that you have come all this way to catch.<br><br>
                        
                        Divide the fight into two halves - in the first part of the fight, the fish will be the boss. Let it do its thing, and do not pull too hard. If you do, it will simply panic, and may leave the pool, which means you will almost certainly have to chase it. Instead, let it settle down. The fish may go back to its lie. One the fireworks slow down, it time to start gently increasing the pressure, and slowly, you will be able to start to get the upper hand.<br><br>
                        
                        Once the fish is tired, work it to the bank. Find a spot which is ideal for your guide to wade in, and communicate with him as to how you want to land the fish. Back your drag off a little and try to keep the fish as calm as possible. Once it is beaten, draw it gently towards the net, and nee ready in case it finds a last reserve of energy.<br><br>
                        
                        Once landed, keep the fish submerged at all times, and photograph it quickly as per the guidelines above. Your guide will quickly weigh and measure the fish, and then you can enjoy the best bit…watching your trophy glide back into the icy waters to continue on its epic journey. Hopefully your grandchildren will be able to fish for its offspring in the years to come.<br><br>

Whilst the start of the run varies significantly with the growing weather fluctuations, we anticipate that it resembles that of the neighboring camps on the peninsula.<br><br>
                                Summer<br>
                                Our scouting missions in 2019 and 2020 have validated the predominantly stronger run in summer, with chrome bright fish beginning to enter the systems from the last week of May, usually peaking in the 3 week of June and presisting to middle of July. <br><br>
        
                                Mid June, is the Prime time to visit Kola Reserve, with cool weather, absence of mosquitoes and  flourishing Atlantic Salmon in the rivers. As the summer progresses, salmon remains in the river, but the typically warmer weather awakens the importunate insects.In august, later part of July we are hosting walking Youth Tours to Lumbovka at a lower pricing point, yet uncompromising on the fishing and lodging experience.<br><br>
        
                                Autumn<br>
                                We are one of a few camps on the peninsular enjoying the Osenka (autumn) salmon run. Commencing in the 2nd week of september, White Sea Salmon begin to rush up Lumbovka and Kachkocka streams. Whilst smaller in size, this breed is typically muscular and persistent, having to spend the whole winter in the rivers.  Our season terminates

                                All foreign nationals fishing on the Kola Reserve will require a Tourist Visa to enter Russia. Acquiring this visa can be a little laborious - particularly for British Nationals - but it is a fairly straightforward process. Around twelve weeks before your trip, please contact Kola Reserve for all relevant paperwork and to help we will help organise your visa.<br><br> 
        
                                If you are a British Passport holder, you will be required to attend a VFS application centre in either London or Edinburgh to hand in your passport and visa application documents, and to provide your barometric data – ie. your fingerprints. Your final documents will be sent to you approximately two weeks prior to departure.<br><br>
        
                                If you are a USA Passport holder, The Fly Shop will help you to prepare all the necessary documents and carry forwards with the application. Please consult your sales manager (or Justin Miller from the Fly Shop) for all the details.<br><br>
                                
                                We suggest that you duplicate or photocopy all documents, including your passport and Russian Visa. Ensure that you keep these copies separate from your originals when you travel. This will be hugely helpful if your passport is mislaid.<br><br>

                                Anglers will fly into Murmansk and will then be transported in a comfortable bus to Lovozero Helibase, where we will fly the group to the Kola Reserve in a Mi8 Helicopter.<br><br>
                                
                                1)	Route with an overnight stay in Murmansk<br><br>
                                
                                We advise that you fly via Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport prior to your arrival in Murmansk.
                                We suggest that you book your flights to arrive to Murmansk on Saturday and spend the Saturday-Sunday night in the Azimut Murnask hotel, at 5,100 Rub per night. This price is a discount with the Azimut hotel and in order to exercise it, please let us know in advance.  We believe Azimut to be the best hotel in the city, therefore we can confidently recommend it to use by our guests (link).<br><br>
                                
                                A Kola Reserve bus will collect the group from the hotel lobby at 9 am.<br><br>
                                
                                2)	Route with an overnight stay in Moscow
                                An alternative travel route can be with an overnight stay in Moscow, from Sat-Sun. We don’t recommend taking this option, since it poses risk of delays and so forth. However, if it is the only available option for your travel, we will lay it out for your convenience.<br><br>
                                
                                If you fly into Moscow Sheremetyevo on Saturday evening, you can spend a night in the Radisson hotel, prior to your flight to Murmansk on Sunday morning.<br><br>
                                
                                The Radisson Blu is an excellent, modern and extremely comfortable hotel just a 4-minute walk from the airport.  It has an excellent restaurant and great facilities, and most anglers bound for the Kola rendezvous here.<br><br>
                                
                                On Sunday morning anglers can then catch the early flight from Sheremetyevo which arrives to Murmansk at around 10 am. We suggest taking an Aeroflot flight SU1320, as described by this link.<br><br>
                                
                                Upon arrival to Murmansk, at no later than 10am, a Kola Reserve bus will collect the fisherman for a drive toward the helicopter base.<br><br>

                                The bus road trip should take up to 2 hours and will accommodate for all the guests and their luggage. The road towards the helicopter base is relatively smooth and has been recently layed by the local government. We don’t plan to make any stops along the way for the lack of sites, so if you will require anything specific along the way, please do let us know.<br><br>

                                The Kola Reserve is in a remote location. Despite the luxurious facilities, guests should remember that they are a long way from civilization, and should make sure that they bring any specific personal items required with them<br><br>
                                
                                HEALTH AND MEDICATION<br><br>
                                
                                Make sure that you have any required medicines with you. The Kola Reserve is in a very remote location, and although there will be a basic medical kit in the camp, be aware that you will not be able to access any pharmaceutical products. Do not travel if you develop a serious medical condition.<br><br>

                                Beer, wine, and vodka will all be available in the lodge. If you want to bring your own favorite tipple, it is best to buy it during the layover in Moscow or Murmansk and bring it with you. We will have a selection of surcharge alcohol on-site, with payments via a card reader. If you require anything specific with which we can help, please let us know in advance.<br><br>

                                The Kola Reserve Lodge has a generator supplying 220v to Euro 2-pin plugs. If you use UK and US electrical plugs, you will need a suitable adapter. The generators will be switched off during the day and at night, so it is best to bring energy-efficient devices that will charge swiftly.<br><br>

                                The latitude of the camps means that it is light for 24hrs a day during the summer season. The rooms will feature light-excluding blinds, but you might consider a “sleep mask” if you think that this will help you sleep.<br><br>

                                In the early season, mosquitoes and blackflies are not a problem. Towards the end of June, however, they do start to become an issue, especially if there is no wind. We suggest that you bring a DEET based Repellent, preferably a roll-on that is easily stowed. Pack it in a small, robust container as DEET can cause terrible damage to expensive fly lines and precious fly collections.<br><br>
                                
                                A wide brimmed hat with a built-in mosquito net is also an excellent investment which may come in useful on windless days<br><br>
                                
                                Also consider antihistamine cream and cetirizine hydrochloride tablets if you are strongly affected by bites.<br><br>

                                You will need some cash to pay for gratuities to the personnel, and also for any flies, leader or sundry items bought from the Lodge Tackle Shop. There will be a card machine at the lodge as well, at your convenience.<br><br>

                                Tips are entirely at your personal discretion. However, it is customary to reward the guides and also the camp staff if you feel that they merit it. We recommend 10% from the trip price in a 60-40 breakdown.<br><br>

                                There will however be Wi-Fi facilities, so you will be able to stay in communication with the outside world. Wi-Fi will be a paid service with 20$ for 2 Gb of data. Through the internet connection our guests can use the Wi-Fi calling technology, which, if pre-set on personal devices before the visit, can be used to call all onthe cellular phones around the globe.<br><br>

                                A small camera is invaluable for recording your trophy fish.<br>
                                A rugged model that is compact, robust and waterproof can be retained in a jacket pocket, ready for use.<br>
                                Make sure you bring a charger and that you have enough room on your memory card. The Kola Reserve is a very special place and you will want to take a lot of pictures.<br><br>
                                
                                When photographing your trophy, please handle your fish with wet hands. Keep the fish submerged at all times until you are absolutely ready to take the pictures. Then lift the fish JUST clear of the water for  just a few seconds, supporting the fish’s weight and keeping the fish’s head in the water or JUST above it.<br><br>
                                
                                Return the fish to the water while you very quickly review the pictures and then release it.<br><br>
                                
                                The Kola Reserve is committed to the long-term sustainability of the fishery, and wants all of its visitors to respect this ethic, by caring for the fish and returning them to the water as quickly and carefully as possible. Please bear this in mind at all times, so that the fish of The Kola Reserve can be allowed to flourish.

                                The Kola Reserve is situated just inside the Arctic Circle. This means that it is often subject to extreme weather conditions.<br><br>
                                
                                The key to getting the best out of the fishing is VERSATILITY - being able to react to respond and adapt to prevailing conditions. This is a maxim that you can apply to how you fish, what you wear… in fact your whole attitude to the trip.<br><br>
                                
                                Each day anglers are rotated between the many beats on the 2 different rivers. You will have access to about 40km of fishable water and you will rotate to enjoy different beats every day of the week. Days are long on the rivers of the Kola Reserve. In fact it is daylight 24 hours a day, in the middle of the summer, being north of the arctic circle. You will fish long and hard on your assigned beat everyday, and then you are welcome to fish at night, on one of the world’s finest home pools until 1am, if you have the energy.<br><br>
        
                                POOL ROTATIONS<br><br>
        
                                To help the anglers get around the pools we deploy a small helicopter and ATVs. Further pools and Kachkovka will be covered by helicopter flights, whilst the closer pools are operated via on land vehicles and boats. <br><br>
        
                                On Kachkovka we have emergency accommodation, if the weather restrains the travel.<br><br>
        
                                CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENT AND FISHING TECHNIQUES<br><br>
                                
                                At the start of the season, in early/mid-June, the winter is only just starting to recede into spring. Snow is a very real possibility and temperatures can  fluctuate from as low as 20°F to perhaps 50° F (-6°C to 10°C). Water temperatures are typically very cold, ranging from 32°F (0°C) to 50°F (10°C). The water is also likely to be affected by snowmelt and spring rains.<br><br>
                                
                                The water will also most likely be relatively high. This means that although the Kola salmon are unusually aggressive, they will be less inclined to come to the surface. Until the water reaches around 8 degrees, anglers will typically be best served by employing Skagit lines that can boss heavy sink tips and relatively big, heavy tubes. Big, bold weighted tube flies like the German Snaelda , Cascade Franc’n’Snaelda or large Templedogs are good choices. Aim to slow the fly down if the water is cold, employing upstream mends and easing the flies into the soft water. The biggest fish of the season typically arrive in the early season so make sure that you employ strong, abrasion resistant leader material, and strong hooks.<br><br>
                                
                                By mid-late June, air temperatures should climb but can still range anywhere from 32°F to 75° F (0°C to 22°C) with icy rain and even blizzards still very much possible. The water temperature at the end of the month can range from 42°F to 57°F (6°C to 14°C). As the water warms, light intermediate tips or even full floating lines are better choices. Swap out your Skagit for a lighter, longer and more refined Scandi head. Combine it with a long tapered leader and dressed Willy Gunn or Ally’s Shrimp double on size 4 to 10 hooks or a big Sunray Shadow on a plastic tube. Once the water reaches 10 degrees, a hitched Sunray can bring some spectacular results.<br><br>
                                
                                Your presentation should now be much faster and more aggressive. Swap the upstream mend of early season for a downstream mend, which will make the fly fish much faster and higher in the water column . Some anglers employ a figure of eight retrieve, but if you choose to do so, keep the rod tip high to introduce a bow in the line. This will allow the salmon to turn around when it takes the fly before it feels resistance , and means that it will be hooked in the “scissors” - the corner of the mouth. This area offers the best chance of a solid hook-hold.<br><br>
                                
                                By July, the relentless twenty four hour daylight has transformed the tundra. Wild flowers garland the silver birch forest and high summer has come to the arctic circle. Air temperatures are now typically 46°F to 80°F (8°C to 27°C) Now is the time for full floating Scandi lines, small doubles like silver stoats and cascades on 8 to 12 hooks, hitched sun rays and even dry flies like bombers and monster caddis patterns. A big red Frances fished fished slow and deep can often tempt a big resident fish, so make sure you also have a Skagit line and some heavier tips with you to present it effectively.<br><br>

                                While there are opportunities to fish with single-handed rods, particularly in the low water of late season, there is no doubt that being able to spey-cast with a double handed rod will allow you to cover much more water and also to mend and control your line. Anyone who really wants to get the best out of The Kola Reserve should be proficient in spey casting. If you are not, be re-assured that it is not hugely difficult. TFS can advise of a spey-casting instructor near you, and a few lessons should soon have you competent enough to effectively fish the waters of The Kola Reserve. Unlike some of the Kola’s larger and more intimidating rivers, the Lumbovka and the Kachkovka are relatively easy to cover, and offer even casters of intermediate ability the chance to catch a trophy Atlantic Salmon.<br><br>
         
                                <b>Rods</b><br><br>
                                
                                The most popular choice of Spey rods for the North Coast of the Kola are in the 8wt or 10wt category between 12.5 and 15 feet long.<br><br>
                                
                                In view of the chances of a trophy fish, and due to the unpredictable nature of the river and the chances of high water on any given day, I would suggest rods of 13 to 15’ in 9 to 10 weight models. There are now a number of rods that are available as 6 piece travel models, and these allow you to travel with them packed into your holdall, without the need for a separate rod case, which will incur excess baggage charges.<br><br>
                                
                                Bring at least two rods, and bring two rods to the river every day in case of breakages. It is a long way back to the lodge, and watching your friend catch all the fish while you are unable to fish is no fun. Two rods also allow you to rig up two separate set-ups - a heavy tip with a skagit line for deep pools and heavy flies, and a full floating Scandi for fishing smaller flies and Sunday Shadows on the surface.<br><br>
                                
                                By all means bring a single-handed rod for fishing in low, warm water conditions ( maybe a 10’ 9wt or 10wt ), but I would expect to use the double hander for most of the fishing.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Reels</b><br><br>
                                
                                Ideally bring two reliable and well-maintained reels with at least 300 yards of good backing – use a minimum of 30lb Dacron or 50lb GSP and make sure that it is wound on in tight coils and NOT bedded in from playing a previous fish. The Kola Reserve offers the possibility of hooking a “once-in-a-lifetime” fish, and these fish will test out your equipment. Don’t lose a 30 pounder because your reel is in poor order.<br><br>
                                
                                <b><a href="#">Lines:</a></b><br><br>
                                
                                I would carry set-ups to fish everywhere from on the surface to deep down in cold, heavy water. We are fishing in the Arctic circle, and if winter hangs on, we may be fishing high, heavy water, but if the snow melts before our arrival, we may be fishing much nearer the surface with smaller flies.<br><br>
                                
                                I fish shooting heads that attach to a running line, so that you can change quickly to adapt to conditions.<br><br>
                                
                                I use recommend the following lines and would bring both to cover all eventualities<br><br>
                                
                                The Lumbovka and Kachkovka are typical of most Kola rivers in that they are not particularly deep. This means that there is very little need to bring heavy, full-sinking lines.<br><br>
                                
                                That said, in high water, heavy sink tips  - and the means to cast them and fish them efficiently - are important<br><br>
                                
                                
                                <b>High Cold Water</b><br><br>
                                
                                I like the Rio Skagit Max for 13’ rods or the Skagit Max Long for 15’ rods. The 700 Grain is perfect for 10 weight rods, with 10’ to 15’ T-tips from T-8 to T-14 for fishing heavy tips & large flies. This line casts big flies and heavy tips easily.<br><br>
                                
                                Medium/Low Water<br><br>
                                
                                My ‘go-to’ line for Medium and Low water is the Rio Scandi “Body” 10/11 with the supplied selection of Tips – for fishing lighter tips and smaller tips, and possibly hitched flies and bombers in warm water conditions.<br><br>
                                
                                In short I would ideally aim to bring two Floating Skagit lines and two floating Scandi lines with a set of interchangeable tips.<br><br>
                                
                                To keep thing simple, I carry a set of 15’ RIO tips of Full Floating, Intermediate, Type 3, Type 6 and Type 8 for fishing with the Scandi Body, with three Type 14 tips of 10’, 12.5’ and 15’ for fishing in deep heavy flows with the Skagit.<br><br>

                                I like the Rio Gripshooter 50lb BS, but many prefer a full coated running line – there are many lines available but suggest that you use nothing under 50lb breaking strain.<br>
                                If you use Gripshooter or other mono lines, wait until the fish has turned on the fly and is taking line and then set HARD to account for the stretch in these running lines.<br><br>
                                
                                
                                <b>Leaders/Tippet:</b><br><br>
                                
                                When fishing deep, I use a shorter leader of 5’ to 8’ made up of a level piece of Seaguar Ace in 30lb, 35lb or 44lb Breaking Strain<br><br>
                                
                                In lower water, I like long leaders and favour the Loop Tapered 17’ Leaders in 30lb B/S.<br>
                                These make casting EASIER and will present your fly beautifully in lower, clearer water.<br>
                                If you choose to use Airflo Polyleaders, get the Extra Strong Version in 42lb Breaking Strain.<br><br>

                                The exploratory group have designed a fly pack to cover all conditions on The Kola Reserve, and we can organise these for anglers who want them<br><br>

                                As stated, the Kola Peninsula is situated inside the Arctic Circle. The Kola Reserve has situated at the far North-East tip of the Kola, and can be subject to violent changes in weather and temperature. You need to be ready for all eventualities if you are going to enjoy your time on the Kola Reserve.<br><br>
         
                                If you are warm and dry, you will fish better, and you will be ready when that big trophy salmon takes your fly…<br><br>
                                
                                <b>LAYERING:</b><br><br>
                                
                                The “layering” system works best with today’s top quality synthetic and wool garments. The idea is that by adding or removing multiple layers of clothing, in varying thickness and insulation, you will be able to obtain ideal body temperature and comfort, instead of just one big layer that you are either hot or cold in.<br><br>
                                
                                Start with a good warm base layer of Merino wool or similar and then use mid-layers which you can add or remove.<br><br>
                                
                                I would recommend at least one Primaloft jacket, which can be stuffed into your dry bag and which will keep you very warm when required.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>SOCKS:</b><br><br>
                                
                                Your socks are crucial to keep your feet warm and comfortable - your feet will be submerged in cold - possibly VERY cold water for much of the day and they need to be warm. Make sure that your socks are a good fit with your waders and boots, and try to fish in them a few times before you come, to make sure that your boots are not too tight or too loose when wearing them. A few different pairs of socks will allow you to adjust to what is most comfortable in response to prevailing conditions.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>RAIN GEAR:</b><br><br>
                                
                                Your rain jacket is important - do not skimp on this. It will keep you dry and will also keep you warm by acting as a wind-block. A custom-designed jacket which allows you freedom of movement and places to store your fly-boxes, tippet etc is a crucial piece of your kit.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>HEADWEAR:</b><br><br>
                                
                                Keeping your head warm is important. Use whatever works for you and you may want to use “Balaclava helmet” style headwear or similar to keep your head as warm as possible.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>GLOVES:</b><br><br>
                                
                                Fishing can be a miserable experience if your hands are cold. Fishing gloves or mittens are a vital part of your kit. I like the SNOWBEE LIGHTWEIGHT NEOPRENE GLOVES which I have used for around ten years. They expose only my forefinger and thumb, which is all I need, and keep the rest of my fingers and hand warm even when wet.<br>
                                They also protect my hands from line cuts, fish’s teeth and so on. Highly recommended.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>GLASSES:</b><br><br>
                                
                                ALWAYS wear glasses when fishing, even if you are not sight-fishing. A pair of Polarising glasses not only protects your eyes from stray hooks, it also allows you to see into the water when wading. They are absolutely invaluable in both respects. I always travel with two pairs - A pair of brown tinted polarisers for brighter days, and a pair of High Light Transmission or yellow lenses for low light. Protect the lenses and keep them on a lanyard or retainer. A brightly coloured neoprene “Croakie” will help you to find them if you put them down.<br><br>
                                
                                There are plenty of excellent polarising glasses I use Maui Jim prescription lenses and frames and they are of extremely high quality.<br><br>
                                
                                
                                
                                
                                <b>WADING</b><br><br>
                                
                                <b>Waders</b><br><br>
                                
                                Tough Stockingfoot Chest waders in good condition are essential. Test your waders and mend any holes or replace them with a new pair. The rivers of The Kola Reserve are cold, and you do not want to spend your week wearing waders full of icy water.<br><br>
                                
                                Pair your waders with a pair of solid and comfortable wading boots. They should be felt soled or studded for extra grip.<br><br>
                                
                                <b>Wading Belt</b><br><br>
                                
                                A Wading Belt is essential. It will prevent water filling your waders if you fall in. It will also allow you to attach a retractable wading staff, which is an essential piece of kit on The Kola Reserve Rivers. If you suffer from Lumbar pain issues, Simms and others make back supports that also double as a belt.<br><br>
                                
                                UV Wader Repair is great for making on the spot repairs - make sure you carry some<br><br>
                                
                                The use of wading sticks is essential. The Simms folding staff attached to a retractor is ideal.<br><br>
                                
                                LIFE JACKETS/BUOYANCY AID<br><br>
                                
                                A Lifejacket or self-inflating buoyancy aid will keep you safe when wading. We believe that it is an essential part of your kit.<br><br>
                                
                                One compressed air canister in a buoyancy aid and one replacement canister are allowed by most airlines.<br><br>
                                
                                Pack these in your checked Hold luggage and NOT your hand luggage, and let your air line know that you are travelling with them.<br><br>

                                Most experienced salmon anglers will know the drill:<br><br>
         
                                Cast, step, repeat…<br><br>
                                
                                However, for those that are new to salmon fishing, here is a brief guide to how to fish each pool.<br><br>
                                
                                Think about what you are trying to do before you start fishing the pool. Do you want to fish the fly quickly, slowly, deep down or near the surface?<br><br>
                                
                                Think about how square you will cast, and whether you will mend upstream or downstream, or not at all.<br><br>
                                
                                Your guide will advise you in detail about this.<br><br>
                                
                                Wade safely and carefully into the river if necessary, and then make your first cast.<br><br>
                                
                                Be ready for a take from the first cast of the day to the last.<br><br>
                                
                                Fish the fly right into the bank and leave it “on the hang” for a few seconds before stripping the fly back prior to your next cast. Once again, a take can come at ANY time, so be ready.<br><br>
                                
                                Then make one to three steps downstream (depending on various factors ) and repeat.<br><br>
                                
                                If a fish takes, let it take the fly and turn away. Do not be in a rush, and only once the fish is drawing away and taking line should you set the hook.<br><br>
                                
                                Getting this right is crucial if you are going to maximise your chances.<br><br>
                                
                                Everyone has their own method, but this works for Matt:<br><br>
                                
                                Matt uses a slack loop of around 1 metre of line that hangs down between the reel and his hand. He holds it in the scissors of his first two fingers, where he simply cannot grip it when he gets a take.<br><br>
                                
                                When the fish takes the fly, the loop allows the fish to turn on the fly without ANY resistance. Others fish “off the reel” with a very light drag, but there has to be SOME resistance with this method, and it means that your drag then has to be adjusted once you are playing the fish. There is also the danger of an over-run.<br><br>
                                
                                If you are using a stretchy mono running line, Matt finds that a smart set, lifting the rod sharply and in to the bank sets the hook, and it has given Matt an excellent ratio of fish encountered to fish on the bank. Once again, remember to WAIT.<br><br>
                                
                                Exclaiming “Fish on!” BEFORE setting the hook helps as a good discipline to make delaying setting the hook.<br><br>
                                
                                About PLAYING A BIG FISH on THE KOLA RESERVE<br><br>
                                
                                Once you have hooked the fish, what next?<br><br>
                                
                                These fish are strong, and they will often surprise you with their acrobatics and bulldozing runs.<br><br>
                                
                                You cannot stop them running, so better to just stay tight and just “enjoy the show”.<br><br>
                                
                                If the fish is a big one, don’t panic, and don’t be in a rush. THIS is the fish that you have come all this way to catch.<br><br>
                                
                                Divide the fight into two halves - in the first part of the fight, the fish will be the boss. Let it do its thing, and do not pull too hard. If you do, it will simply panic, and may leave the pool, which means you will almost certainly have to chase it. Instead, let it settle down. The fish may go back to its lie. One the fireworks slow down, it time to start gently increasing the pressure, and slowly, you will be able to start to get the upper hand.<br><br>
                                
                                Once the fish is tired, work it to the bank. Find a spot which is ideal for your guide to wade in, and communicate with him as to how you want to land the fish. Back your drag off a little and try to keep the fish as calm as possible. Once it is beaten, draw it gently towards the net, and nee ready in case it finds a last reserve of energy.<br><br>
                                
                                Once landed, keep the fish submerged at all times, and photograph it quickly as per the guidelines above. Your guide will quickly weigh and measure the fish, and then you can enjoy the best bit…watching your trophy glide back into the icy waters to continue on its epic journey. Hopefully your grandchildren will be able to fish for its offspring in the years to come.<br><br>

Check with your insurance broker for options on this type insurance.
                                All rates are subject to change without notice but will not change once booking is confirmed.
