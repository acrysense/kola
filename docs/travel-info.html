                    <p>
                        Kola Reserve benefits from its location on the boarder of White and Barents seas, as we have summer and autumn run. Whilst the start of the run varies significantly with the growing weather fluctuations, we anticipate that it resembles that of the neighboring camps on the peninsula.<br><br>
                        Summer<br>
                        Our scouting missions in 2019 and 2020 have validated the predominantly stronger run in summer, with chrome bright fish beginning to enter the systems from the last week of May, usually peaking in the 3 week of June and presisting to middle of July. <br><br>

                        Mid June, is the Prime time to visit Kola Reserve, with cool weather, absence of mosquitoes and  flourishing Atlantic Salmon in the rivers. As the summer progresses, salmon remains in the river, but the typically warmer weather awakens the importunate insects.In august, later part of July we are hosting walking Youth Tours to Lumbovka at a lower pricing point, yet uncompromising on the fishing and lodging experience.<br><br>

                        Autumn<br>
                        We are one of a few camps on the peninsular enjoying the Osenka (autumn) salmon run. Commencing in the 2nd week of september, White Sea Salmon begin to rush up Lumbovka and Kachkocka streams. Whilst smaller in size, this breed is typically muscular and persistent, having to spend the whole winter in the rivers.  Our season terminates

                    <p>
                        VISAS
 
                        All foreign nationals fishing on the Kola Reserve will require a Tourist Visa to enter Russia. Acquiring this visa can be a little laborious - particularly for British Nationals - but it is a fairly straightforward process. Around twelve weeks before your trip, please contact Kola Reserve for all relevant paperwork and to help we will help organise your visa. 

                        If you are a British Passport holder, you will be required to attend a VFS application centre in either London or Edinburgh to hand in your passport and visa application documents, and to provide your barometric data – ie. your fingerprints. Your final documents will be sent to you approximately two weeks prior to departure.

                        If you are a USA Passport holder, The Fly Shop will help you to prepare all the necessary documents and carry forwards with the application. Please consult your sales manager (or Justin Miller from the Fly Shop) for all the details.
                        
                        We suggest that you duplicate or photocopy all documents, including your passport and Russian Visa. Ensure that you keep these copies separate from your originals when you travel. This will be hugely helpful if your passport is mislaid.
                        
                        TRAVEL INSURANCE
                        
                        Please ensure that you have adequate insurance cover for your trip. Occasionally we can experience delays in Russia due to unforeseen circumstances and flight connections can occasionally be missed, resulting in extra charges.
                        
                        If your insurers do not offer comprehensive Medical Evacuation –
                        ( Medivac ) Insurance we strongly recommend Global Rescue
                        https://www.globalrescue.com/
                        
                        The Kola Reserve cannot be held responsible to clients for any costs incurred, nor for compensation in respect of delays, alterations or cancellations of any flight with an airline or air charter company.
                        
                        
                        ITINERARY - 

                        FLIGHTS
                        
                        The Kola Reserve will fish from Sunday to Sunday.
                        
                        Anglers will fly into Murmansk and will then be transported in a comfortable bus to Lovozero Helibase, where we will fly the group to the Kola Reserve in a Mi8 Helicopter.
                        
                        1)	Route with an overnight stay in Murmansk
                        
                        We advise that you fly via Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport prior to your arrival in Murmansk.
                        We suggest that you book your flights to arrive to Murmansk on Saturday and spend the Saturday-Sunday night in the Azimut Murnask hotel, at 5,100 Rub per night. This price is a discount with the Azimut hotel and in order to exercise it, please let us know in advance.  We believe Azimut to be the best hotel in the city, therefore we can confidently recommend it to use by our guests (link).
                        
                        A Kola Reserve bus will collect the group from the hotel lobby at 9 am.
                        
                        2)	Route with an overnight stay in Moscow
                        An alternative travel route can be with an overnight stay in Moscow, from Sat-Sun. We don’t recommend taking this option, since it poses risk of delays and so forth. However, if it is the only available option for your travel, we will lay it out for your convenience.
                        
                        If you fly into Moscow Sheremetyevo on Saturday evening, you can spend a night in the Radisson hotel, prior to your flight to Murmansk on Sunday morning.
                        
                        The Radisson Blu is an excellent, modern and extremely comfortable hotel just a 4-minute walk from the airport.  It has an excellent restaurant and great facilities, and most anglers bound for the Kola rendezvous here.
                        
                        On Sunday morning anglers can then catch the early flight from Sheremetyevo which arrives to Murmansk at around 10 am. We suggest taking an Aeroflot flight SU1320, as described by this link.
                        
                        Upon arrival to Murmansk, at no later than 10am, a Kola Reserve bus will collect the fisherman for a drive toward the helicopter base.
                        
                        DRIVE TO THE HELIBASE
                        
                        The bus road trip should take up to 2 hours and will accommodate for all the guests and their luggage. The road towards the helicopter base is relatively smooth and has been recently layed by the local government. We don’t plan to make any stops along the way for the lack of sites, so if you will require anything specific along the way, please do let us know.
                        
                        RETURN
                        
                        After 6 full days fishing, We will fly back out of the camp on the following Sunday ( in the Mi 8 Helicopter, in time to catch the Murmansk > Sheremetyevo flight. 

                        A MI-8 helicopter will depart for Lovozero from the main camp at 11.30am, arriving to Lovozero by 1pm. At this point, the group will be on boarded onto a bus heading to Murmansk Airport.
                        
                        We arrive back at Murmansk Airport at around 4pm on Sunday, so we strongly advise you do not book your onward flight from Murmansk before 6pm. We can help you with these arrangements if you wish.

                    <h3 id="title3">ABOUT LIFE AT THE KOLA RESERVE</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Kola Reserve is in a remote location. Despite the luxurious facilities, guests should remember that they are a long way from civilization, and should make sure that they bring any specific personal items required with them
                        
                        HEALTH AND MEDICATION
                        
                        Make sure that you have any required medicines with you. The Kola Reserve is in a very remote location, and although there will be a basic medical kit in the camp, be aware that you will not be able to access any pharmaceutical products. Do not travel if you develop a serious medical condition.
                        
                        
                        ALCOHOL
                        
                        Beer, wine, and vodka will all be available in the lodge. If you want to bring your own favorite tipple, it is best to buy it during the layover in Moscow or Murmansk and bring it with you. We will have a selection of surcharge alcohol on-site, with payments via a card reader. If you require anything specific with which we can help, please let us know in advance.
                        
                        ELECTRICITY
                        
                        The Kola Reserve Lodge has a generator supplying 220v to Euro 2-pin plugs. If you use UK and US electrical plugs, you will need a suitable adapter. The generators will be switched off during the day and at night, so it is best to bring energy-efficient devices that will charge swiftly.
                        
                        SLEEPING
                        
                        The latitude of the camps means that it is light for 24hrs a day during the summer season. The rooms will feature light-excluding blinds, but you might consider a “sleep mask” if you think that this will help you sleep.
                        
                        MOSQUITOES
                        
                        In the early season, mosquitoes and blackflies are not a problem. Towards the end of June, however, they do start to become an issue, especially if there is no wind. We suggest that you bring a DEET based Repellent, preferably a roll-on that is easily stowed. Pack it in a small, robust container as DEET can cause terrible damage to expensive fly lines and precious fly collections.
                        
                        A wide brimmed hat with a built-in mosquito net is also an excellent investment which may come in useful on windless days
                        
                        Also consider antihistamine cream and cetirizine hydrochloride tablets if you are strongly affected by bites.
                        
                        
                        CASH
                        
                        You will need some cash to pay for gratuities to the personnel, and also for any flies, leader or sundry items bought from the Lodge Tackle Shop. There will be a card machine at the lodge as well, at your convenience.
                        
                        GRATUITIES
                        
                        Tips are entirely at your personal discretion. However, it is customary to reward the guides and also the camp staff if you feel that they merit it. We recommend 10% from the trip price in a 60-40 breakdown.

                        A small camera is invaluable for recording your trophy fish.
                        A rugged model that is compact, robust and waterproof can be retained in a jacket pocket, ready for use.
                        Make sure you bring a charger and that you have enough room on your memory card. The Kola Reserve is a very special place and you will want to take a lot of pictures.
                        
                        When photographing your trophy, please handle your fish with wet hands. Keep the fish submerged at all times until you are absolutely ready to take the pictures. Then lift the fish JUST clear of the water for  just a few seconds, supporting the fish’s weight and keeping the fish’s head in the water or JUST above it.
                        
                        Return the fish to the water while you very quickly review the pictures and then release it.
                        
                        The Kola Reserve is committed to the long-term sustainability of the fishery, and wants all of its visitors to respect this ethic, by caring for the fish and returning them to the water as quickly and carefully as possible. Please bear this in mind at all times, so that the fish of The Kola Reserve can be allowed to flourish.

                    <p>
                        GENERAL

                        The Kola Reserve is situated just inside the Arctic Circle. This means that it is often subject to extreme weather conditions.
                        
                        The key to getting the best out of the fishing is VERSATILITY - being able to react to respond and adapt to prevailing conditions. This is a maxim that you can apply to how you fish, what you wear… in fact your whole attitude to the trip.
                        
                        Each day anglers are rotated between the many beats on the 2 different rivers. You will have access to about 40km of fishable water and you will rotate to enjoy different beats every day of the week. Days are long on the rivers of the Kola Reserve. In fact it is daylight 24 hours a day, in the middle of the summer, being north of the arctic circle. You will fish long and hard on your assigned beat everyday, and then you are welcome to fish at night, on one of the world’s finest home pools until 1am, if you have the energy.

                        POOL ROTATIONS

                        To help the anglers get around the pools we deploy a small helicopter and ATVs. Further pools and Kachkovka will be covered by helicopter flights, whilst the closer pools are operated via on land vehicles and boats. 

                        On Kachkovka we have emergency accommodation, if the weather restrains the travel.

                        CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENT AND FISHING TECHNIQUES
                        
                        At the start of the season, in early/mid-June, the winter is only just starting to recede into spring. Snow is a very real possibility and temperatures can  fluctuate from as low as 20°F to perhaps 50° F (-6°C to 10°C). Water temperatures are typically very cold, ranging from 32°F (0°C) to 50°F (10°C). The water is also likely to be affected by snowmelt and spring rains.
                        
                        The water will also most likely be relatively high. This means that although the Kola salmon are unusually aggressive, they will be less inclined to come to the surface. Until the water reaches around 8 degrees, anglers will typically be best served by employing Skagit lines that can boss heavy sink tips and relatively big, heavy tubes. Big, bold weighted tube flies like the German Snaelda , Cascade Franc’n’Snaelda or large Templedogs are good choices. Aim to slow the fly down if the water is cold, employing upstream mends and easing the flies into the soft water. The biggest fish of the season typically arrive in the early season so make sure that you employ strong, abrasion resistant leader material, and strong hooks.
                        
                        By mid-late June, air temperatures should climb but can still range anywhere from 32°F to 75° F (0°C to 22°C) with icy rain and even blizzards still very much possible. The water temperature at the end of the month can range from 42°F to 57°F (6°C to 14°C). As the water warms, light intermediate tips or even full floating lines are better choices. Swap out your Skagit for a lighter, longer and more refined Scandi head. Combine it with a long tapered leader and dressed Willy Gunn or Ally’s Shrimp double on size 4 to 10 hooks or a big Sunray Shadow on a plastic tube. Once the water reaches 10 degrees, a hitched Sunray can bring some spectacular results.
                        
                        Your presentation should now be much faster and more aggressive. Swap the upstream mend of early season for a downstream mend, which will make the fly fish much faster and higher in the water column . Some anglers employ a figure of eight retrieve, but if you choose to do so, keep the rod tip high to introduce a bow in the line. This will allow the salmon to turn around when it takes the fly before it feels resistance , and means that it will be hooked in the “scissors” - the corner of the mouth. This area offers the best chance of a solid hook-hold.
                        
                        By July, the relentless twenty four hour daylight has transformed the tundra. Wild flowers garland the silver birch forest and high summer has come to the arctic circle. Air temperatures are now typically 46°F to 80°F (8°C to 27°C) Now is the time for full floating Scandi lines, small doubles like silver stoats and cascades on 8 to 12 hooks, hitched sun rays and even dry flies like bombers and monster caddis patterns. A big red Frances fished fished slow and deep can often tempt a big resident fish, so make sure you also have a Skagit line and some heavier tips with you to present it effectively.

                                Kola Reserve benefits from its location on the boarder of White and Barents seas, as we have summer and autumn run. Whilst the start of the run varies significantly with the growing weather fluctuations, we anticipate that it resembles that of the neighboring camps on the peninsula.<br><br>
                                Summer<br>
                                Our scouting missions in 2019 and 2020 have validated the predominantly stronger run in summer, with chrome bright fish beginning to enter the systems from the last week of May, usually peaking in the 3 week of June and presisting to middle of July. <br><br>
        
                                Mid June, is the Prime time to visit Kola Reserve, with cool weather, absence of mosquitoes and  flourishing Atlantic Salmon in the rivers. As the summer progresses, salmon remains in the river, but the typically warmer weather awakens the importunate insects.In august, later part of July we are hosting walking Youth Tours to Lumbovka at a lower pricing point, yet uncompromising on the fishing and lodging experience.<br><br>

                                We are one of a few camps on the peninsular enjoying the Osenka (autumn) salmon run. Commencing in the 2nd week of september, White Sea Salmon begin to rush up Lumbovka and Kachkocka streams. Whilst smaller in size, this breed is typically muscular and persistent, having to spend the whole winter in the rivers.  Our season terminates

                                VISAS
         
                                All foreign nationals fishing on the Kola Reserve will require a Tourist Visa to enter Russia. Acquiring this visa can be a little laborious - particularly for British Nationals - but it is a fairly straightforward process. Around twelve weeks before your trip, please contact Kola Reserve for all relevant paperwork and to help we will help organise your visa. 
        
                                If you are a British Passport holder, you will be required to attend a VFS application centre in either London or Edinburgh to hand in your passport and visa application documents, and to provide your barometric data – ie. your fingerprints. Your final documents will be sent to you approximately two weeks prior to departure.
        
                                If you are a USA Passport holder, The Fly Shop will help you to prepare all the necessary documents and carry forwards with the application. Please consult your sales manager (or Justin Miller from the Fly Shop) for all the details.
                                
                                We suggest that you duplicate or photocopy all documents, including your passport and Russian Visa. Ensure that you keep these copies separate from your originals when you travel. This will be hugely helpful if your passport is mislaid.

                                Anglers will fly into Murmansk and will then be transported in a comfortable bus to Lovozero Helibase, where we will fly the group to the Kola Reserve in a Mi8 Helicopter.
                                
                                1)	Route with an overnight stay in Murmansk
                                
                                We advise that you fly via Moscow Sheremetyevo Airport prior to your arrival in Murmansk.
                                We suggest that you book your flights to arrive to Murmansk on Saturday and spend the Saturday-Sunday night in the Azimut Murnask hotel, at 5,100 Rub per night. This price is a discount with the Azimut hotel and in order to exercise it, please let us know in advance.  We believe Azimut to be the best hotel in the city, therefore we can confidently recommend it to use by our guests (link).
                                
                                A Kola Reserve bus will collect the group from the hotel lobby at 9 am.
                                
                                2)	Route with an overnight stay in Moscow
                                An alternative travel route can be with an overnight stay in Moscow, from Sat-Sun. We don’t recommend taking this option, since it poses risk of delays and so forth. However, if it is the only available option for your travel, we will lay it out for your convenience.
                                
                                If you fly into Moscow Sheremetyevo on Saturday evening, you can spend a night in the Radisson hotel, prior to your flight to Murmansk on Sunday morning.
                                
                                The Radisson Blu is an excellent, modern and extremely comfortable hotel just a 4-minute walk from the airport.  It has an excellent restaurant and great facilities, and most anglers bound for the Kola rendezvous here.
                                
                                On Sunday morning anglers can then catch the early flight from Sheremetyevo which arrives to Murmansk at around 10 am. We suggest taking an Aeroflot flight SU1320, as described by this link.
                                
                                Upon arrival to Murmansk, at no later than 10am, a Kola Reserve bus will collect the fisherman for a drive toward the helicopter base.
                                
                                DRIVE TO THE HELIBASE
                                
                                The bus road trip should take up to 2 hours and will accommodate for all the guests and their luggage. The road towards the helicopter base is relatively smooth and has been recently layed by the local government. We don’t plan to make any stops along the way for the lack of sites, so if you will require anything specific along the way, please do let us know.
                                
                                RETURN

We will have a selection of surcharge alcohol on-site, with payments via a card reader. If you require anything specific with which we can help, please let us know in advance.
                                
                                ELECTRICITY
                                
                                The Kola Reserve Lodge has a generator supplying 220v to Euro 2-pin plugs. If you use UK and US electrical plugs, you will need a suitable adapter. The generators will be switched off during the day and at night, so it is best to bring energy-efficient devices that will charge swiftly.
                                
                                SLEEPING
                                
                                The latitude of the camps means that it is light for 24hrs a day during the summer season. The rooms will feature light-excluding blinds, but you might consider a “sleep mask” if you think that this will help you sleep.
                                
                                MOSQUITOES
                                
                                In the early season, mosquitoes and blackflies are not a problem. Towards the end of June, however, they do start to become an issue, especially if there is no wind. We suggest that you bring a DEET based Repellent, preferably a roll-on that is easily stowed. Pack it in a small, robust container as DEET can cause terrible damage to expensive fly lines and precious fly collections.
                                
                                A wide brimmed hat with a built-in mosquito net is also an excellent investment which may come in useful on windless days
                                
                                Also consider antihistamine cream and cetirizine hydrochloride tablets if you are strongly affected by bites.

                                You will need some cash to pay for gratuities to the personnel, and also for any flies, leader or sundry items bought from the Lodge Tackle Shop. There will be a card machine at the lodge as well, at your convenience.

                                Tips are entirely at your personal discretion. However, it is customary to reward the guides and also the camp staff if you feel that they merit it. We recommend 10% from the trip price in a 60-40 breakdown.

                                There will however be Wi-Fi facilities, so you will be able to stay in communication with the outside world. Wi-Fi will be a paid service with 20$ for 2 Gb of data. Through the internet connection our guests can use the Wi-Fi calling technology, which, if pre-set on personal devices before the visit, can be used to call all onthe cellular phones around the globe.

                                A small camera is invaluable for recording your trophy fish.
                                A rugged model that is compact, robust and waterproof can be retained in a jacket pocket, ready for use.
                                Make sure you bring a charger and that you have enough room on your memory card. The Kola Reserve is a very special place and you will want to take a lot of pictures.
                                
                                When photographing your trophy, please handle your fish with wet hands. Keep the fish submerged at all times until you are absolutely ready to take the pictures. Then lift the fish JUST clear of the water for  just a few seconds, supporting the fish’s weight and keeping the fish’s head in the water or JUST above it.
                                
                                Return the fish to the water while you very quickly review the pictures and then release it.
                                
                                The Kola Reserve is committed to the long-term sustainability of the fishery, and wants all of its visitors to respect this ethic, by caring for the fish and returning them to the water as quickly and carefully as possible. Please bear this in mind at all times, so that the fish of The Kola Reserve can be allowed to flourish.

                                GENERAL

                                The Kola Reserve is situated just inside the Arctic Circle. This means that it is often subject to extreme weather conditions.
                                
                                The key to getting the best out of the fishing is VERSATILITY - being able to react to respond and adapt to prevailing conditions. This is a maxim that you can apply to how you fish, what you wear… in fact your whole attitude to the trip.
                                
                                Each day anglers are rotated between the many beats on the 2 different rivers. You will have access to about 40km of fishable water and you will rotate to enjoy different beats every day of the week. Days are long on the rivers of the Kola Reserve. In fact it is daylight 24 hours a day, in the middle of the summer, being north of the arctic circle. You will fish long and hard on your assigned beat everyday, and then you are welcome to fish at night, on one of the world’s finest home pools until 1am, if you have the energy.

                                POOL ROTATIONS

                                To help the anglers get around the pools we deploy a small helicopter and ATVs. Further pools and Kachkovka will be covered by helicopter flights, whilst the closer pools are operated via on land vehicles and boats. 

                                On Kachkovka we have emergency accommodation, if the weather restrains the travel.

                                CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENT AND FISHING TECHNIQUES
                                
                                At the start of the season, in early/mid-June, the winter is only just starting to recede into spring. Snow is a very real possibility and temperatures can  fluctuate from as low as 20°F to perhaps 50° F (-6°C to 10°C). Water temperatures are typically very cold, ranging from 32°F (0°C) to 50°F (10°C). The water is also likely to be affected by snowmelt and spring rains.
                                
                                The water will also most likely be relatively high. This means that although the Kola salmon are unusually aggressive, they will be less inclined to come to the surface. Until the water reaches around 8 degrees, anglers will typically be best served by employing Skagit lines that can boss heavy sink tips and relatively big, heavy tubes. Big, bold weighted tube flies like the German Snaelda , Cascade Franc’n’Snaelda or large Templedogs are good choices. Aim to slow the fly down if the water is cold, employing upstream mends and easing the flies into the soft water. The biggest fish of the season typically arrive in the early season so make sure that you employ strong, abrasion resistant leader material, and strong hooks.
                                
                                By mid-late June, air temperatures should climb but can still range anywhere from 32°F to 75° F (0°C to 22°C) with icy rain and even blizzards still very much possible. The water temperature at the end of the month can range from 42°F to 57°F (6°C to 14°C). As the water warms, light intermediate tips or even full floating lines are better choices. Swap out your Skagit for a lighter, longer and more refined Scandi head. Combine it with a long tapered leader and dressed Willy Gunn or Ally’s Shrimp double on size 4 to 10 hooks or a big Sunray Shadow on a plastic tube. Once the water reaches 10 degrees, a hitched Sunray can bring some spectacular results.
                                
                                Your presentation should now be much faster and more aggressive. Swap the upstream mend of early season for a downstream mend, which will make the fly fish much faster and higher in the water column . Some anglers employ a figure of eight retrieve, but if you choose to do so, keep the rod tip high to introduce a bow in the line. This will allow the salmon to turn around when it takes the fly before it feels resistance , and means that it will be hooked in the “scissors” - the corner of the mouth. This area offers the best chance of a solid hook-hold.
                                
                                By July, the relentless twenty four hour daylight has transformed the tundra. Wild flowers garland the silver birch forest and high summer has come to the arctic circle. Air temperatures are now typically 46°F to 80°F (8°C to 27°C) Now is the time for full floating Scandi lines, small doubles like silver stoats and cascades on 8 to 12 hooks, hitched sun rays and even dry flies like bombers and monster caddis patterns. A big red Frances fished fished slow and deep can often tempt a big resident fish, so make sure you also have a Skagit line and some heavier tips with you to present it effectively.
